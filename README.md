# APEzor

(Semi) Auto generates a PEZor payload to my liking  
I got tired of repeating tedious tasks ...  
Created it so everyone else can have an easy time and relax like Donkey Kong ^    

## What it do?
1. Grabs latest PEZor dependencies 
2. Guides through creating a generic PEzor payload.
3. Integrates Go shellcode loader via Bankai

## How do?

```
cd <pick preferred directory>
git clone <repo link HTTP or SSH>
chmod +x APEzor.sh
./APEzor.sh
```


**Note:** Works in conjunction with Cobalt Strike

*Your mileage may vary for other C2s. But it still downloads what you need to be on your way. ¬‿¬*
