# APEzor

(Semi) Auto generates a PEZor payload to my liking!
I got tired of repeating tedious tasks ...

## What it do?
Grabs dependencies and guides through creating a generic PEzor payload. 

**Note:** Works in conjunction with Cobalt Strike

*Your mileage may vary for other C2s. But it still downloads what you need to be on your way. ¬‿¬*
