# APEzor

(Semi) Auto generates a PEZor payload to my liking  
I got tired of repeating tedious tasks ...  
Created it so everyone else can have an easy time  

## What it do?
[^1] Grabs latest PEZor dependencies 
[^2] Guides through creating a generic PEzor payload. 


**Note:** Works in conjunction with Cobalt Strike

*Your mileage may vary for other C2s. But it still downloads what you need to be on your way. ¬‿¬*
